***Problem Description***  
You are required to implement an Internet based College Course application system for the University using Java RMI. The server allows a client to login and retrieve an ApplicationForm object that will then be completed on the client side. The client can then submit the completed ApplicationForm object back to the server for validation and processing. The design of the system makes it possible for new ApplicationForm implementation classes to be easily added to the server in the future, making the system very flexible.
